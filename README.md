    * If you have another version installed or don't want to mess with your system, use [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/).
2. Ready to go!

## Development
To work on a bug or new feature:
1. Assign yourself to the relevant issue.
2. Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name, e.g. `login-redesign`.
3. Commit and push your work.
4. Submit a pull request.
5. Review the comments on the pull request (if any).

And voil√†! Now you just have to wait for an administrator to merge your branch into `master`.
